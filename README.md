○ 👋 Hi, I’m @Fluijin
○ 👀 I’m interested in 3D Modelling using SketchUp and Blender. I model 3D buildings for a mod we are developing for an indie game called Mashinky. 
  ▢ Check them out here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/598960/Mashinky/
  ▢ Our mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2114741977&searchtext=expansion
○ 🌱 I’m currently learning proper and efficient 3D rendering 
○ 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects or any projects that would need 3D buildings.
